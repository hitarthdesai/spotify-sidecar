A sideccar app to Spotify allowing people to create and save mashups of songs.

It facilitates people to use Sptify tracks, and cut and join segments of the tracks to
create these mashups.

Ideally, people use this app through a audio-editing tool-like interface, where they can
crop tracks and move them around.

Work on this project was abandoned soon after beginning this project amongst more important
commitments, however, I plan to come back to this project soon.
